# Pipelined and Single Cycle MIPS Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of both **Pipelined MIPS** and **Single Cycle MIPS** architectures. The pipelined version includes support for handling **data hazards**, **load-use hazards**, and **branch hazards**.

## Features
- Implementation of Single Cycle MIPS
- Implementation of Pipelined MIPS with:
  - Data Hazard Handling
  - Load-Use Hazard Handling
  - Branch Hazard Handling

## Instructions for Usage

1. **Load the Control Unit:**
   - Place your control signals in `control.hex`.

2. **Prepare Your MIPS Instructions:**
   - Write your MIPS assembly instructions in `test.txt`.

3. **Assemble Instructions:**
   - Compile the MIPS instructions by running:
     ```
     g++ assembler.cpp -o assembler
     ./assembler
     ```
   - This will generate the `instruction.hex` file.

4. **Load the Instruction Memory:**
   - Use the generated `instruction.hex` file to load instructions into the instruction memory of the simulator.

## File Structure
- `assembler.cpp`: Converts MIPS assembly instructions from `test.txt` to `instruction.hex`.
- `test.txt`: Input file for writing your MIPS assembly instructions.
- `control.hex`: Contains the control signals for the Control Unit.
- `instruction.hex`: Output file generated by the assembler for loading into Instruction Memory.

## How to Run
1. Edit `test.txt` to include your MIPS instructions.
2. Compile and run `assembler.cpp` to generate the instruction memory file.
3. Load the `control.hex` into the Control Unit.
4. Load the `instruction.hex` into the Instruction Memory.
5. Run the MIPS simulator with the desired architecture (Pipelined or Single Cycle).

## Hazards Handled in Pipelined MIPS
1. **Data Hazards**: Ensures correct instruction execution when data dependencies exist.
2. **Load-Use Hazards**: Handles cases where data from a load instruction is immediately needed.
3. **Branch Hazards**: Correctly resolves branch decisions to maintain pipeline integrity.
